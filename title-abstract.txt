Title:
Hierarchical Latent Variable Models for Neural Data Analysis

Abstract:
When the brain receives a stimulus, the associated information is encoded to inform a neural response. The goal of neural coding is to describe the sensory stimuli responsible for neural and behavioral responses, which can be measured through electrode arrays and imaging techniques. Decoding such measurements has several uses, including the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) prosthetics, which assist in and repair motor functions. Our research builds upon established dimensional reduction techniques and Bayesian inference in order to create machine learning models for decoding that account for both temporal correlations and the non-negative support of neural activity data. Specifically, we aim to learn latent neural trajectories (lower dimensional systems underlying observed neural behavior) by applying variational Gaussian process factor analysis (vLGP) to spike train data recorded from studies on decision-making in mice. This modification of GPFA assumes that spike counts are poisson-distributed, and consequently utilizes variational inference to address the issue of  non-conjugate priors in the latent space by maximizing the evidence-based lower bound (ELBo). Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between neural activity in two brain regions - the Superior Colliculus Deep Gray Layer and the Superior Colliculus Intermediate White Layer - during a decision making task, using Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (pCCA).
